# Work Day Scheduler Challenge

## Description

This chalenges required us to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour. A starter code was provided for us to modify and the Day.js library was used. 
My application is still in progress, but once completed it should present color coded timeblocks and save events into the local storage.
